This document is a starting point for anyone who wants to hack on Online Python Tutor

The frontend consists of:

visualize.html
css/opt-frontend.css
js/opt-frontend.js
css/pytutor.css
js/pytutor.js
<a bunch of auxiliary css and js files such as libraries>


The backend consists of:

pg_logger.py  - the main entry point to the OPT backend
pg_encoder.py - encodes the trace format into JSON to send to frontend
generate_json_trace.py - script to test the backend independent of the frontend


~worry about these later
app.yaml, pythontutor.py - files for deploying on Google App Engine
web_exec.py - example CGI script for deploying backend on CGI-enabled webservers
